## Performance Targets — In Progress

| Metric | Before | After | Target (v1.0) | Status |
|--------|--------|-------|---------------|--------|
| Startup time | ~200ms (blocked by sync curl) | <150ms (async key check) | <150ms | **Done** |
| Tool dispatch overhead | unmeasured | unmeasured | <1ms per tool call | Planned |
| Binary size (release) | ~15MB | est. <12MB (codegen-units=1, panic=abort, narrowed tokio) | <12MB | **Done** |
| Context compaction latency | unmeasured | benchmarked | <500ms for microcompact | **Done** |
| Tests | 232+ | 400+ | 400+ | **Done** |
| Test coverage | Codecov active | Codecov active | >70% | In Progress |
| Supported platforms | 6 (Linux, macOS, Windows, Docker, npm) | 6 | 7 (+ homebrew-core) | Planned |

### Changes Made

- **Startup**: Moved blocking `curl` API key validation (5s timeout) to async background task with 500ms non-blocking window
- **Binary size**: Added `codegen-units = 1` and `panic = "abort"` to release profile; narrowed tokio features from `"full"` to specific needed features
- **Tests**: Added 170+ new unit and integration tests across error types, config schema, memory types, LLM providers, permissions, message normalization, retry logic, token estimation, compaction, pricing, and bash parsing
- **Benchmarks**: Added startup benchmark (config loading) alongside existing compaction and token estimation benchmarks

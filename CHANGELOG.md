## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`/pentest` bundled skill**: five-phase white-box penetration test workflow (recon → slice → vuln analysis → exploit-or-discard → report) with a proof-of-concept gating policy — findings without a reproducible PoC are demoted to INFO or dropped. Runs entirely in-session against a target directory and writes a severity-grouped markdown report.
- **`/effort` command** (#150): rates task complexity XS/S/M/L/XL with a one-line justification and top 2 risks. No-arg form rates the task currently being discussed; `/effort <task>` rates a supplied description.
- **`/break-cache` command** (#151): forces the next outgoing request to skip the prompt cache so the cache prefix is rebuilt. One-shot flag on `AppState`, consumed after the next request. Useful for mid-session config changes or debugging cache behavior.
- **`/heapdump` command** (#152, hidden from `/help`): writes a best-effort process memory snapshot (VmRSS / VmSize / VmPeak / per-segment on Linux; `ps -o rss,vsz` on macOS) to a timestamped file under the data directory.
- **`/btw` command** (#153): quick-capture note to user memory without going through the model. Writes a timestamped markdown file with slugified filename and updates `MEMORY.md` index.
- **`/rename` command** (#154): attaches a human-readable label to the current session. Surfaced in `/sessions` listings; empty arg clears the label. New `label: Option<String>` on `SessionData`, serde-defaulted for backward compat.
- **`/add-dir` command** (#155): tracks additional directories alongside cwd in the session's working set. Injected into the system prompt under `# Environment`. Paths are canonicalized on add. Forms: list, add, `--remove <path>`, `--clear`. Session-scoped (not persisted).
- **`remember` bundled skill** (#156): saves an insight to user memory using the two-step write discipline (file + MEMORY.md index) with correct type classification.
- **`stuck` bundled skill** (#157): forces the agent to name the shared assumption behind failed attempts, propose two different approaches, and take one concrete step without retrying what already failed.
- **`simplify` bundled skill** (#158): review-then-simplify pass on the current diff — flags dead weight (unused imports, premature abstractions, speculative error handling, defensive copies, comments restating code).
- **`/thinkback` command** (#159): surfaces the model's extended-thinking blocks from a recent assistant turn. `/thinkback` shows the latest; `/thinkback <n>` walks back N turns (1 = latest).
- **`/usage` command** (#160): per-turn token timeline table (model, input, output, cache read, cache write) plus a cache-hit-rate hint. Complements `/cost` which aggregates.
- **`batch` bundled skill** (#162): applies the same change across multiple git worktrees — one worktree per target, test+lint gate per target, first failure stops the run.
- **`skillify` bundled skill** (#163): extracts the productive workflow from the current session into a reusable `.agent/skills/<name>.md` file with YAML frontmatter and imperative numbered steps.
- **`/pr-comments` command** (#164): fetches inline + issue comments on a PR via `gh`, groups them into (unresolved / action-requested / resolved), and produces a triage list with file:line, author quote, and suggested response or fix per item.
- **`/autofix-pr` command** (#165): checks out a PR in an isolated worktree, detects the toolchain, runs the lint + test gate, applies minimal fixes with re-verification after each, commits, and pushes back. Never force-pushes, never skips hooks, never modifies tests to make them pass.
- **`/perf-issue` command** (#166): report-only performance regression audit on the current diff (or named target). Looks for N+1 queries, missing indexes, sync I/O on hot paths, allocation hotspots, quadratic algorithms, cache invalidation bugs, unbounded growth, and sync-in-async patterns.

### Fixed

- **Tarpaulin coverage flake** (#161): switched `cargo tarpaulin` to `--engine llvm` in CI. The default ptrace engine raced with tokio's child-process reaper on cancellation tests, producing spurious ECHILD / multi-terabyte allocation failures. LLVM engine uses source-based coverage with no ptrace.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **Release binary segfault on systems with glibc < 2.39** (#134): pinned Linux release builders from `ubuntu-latest` to `ubuntu-22.04` (glibc 2.35) so the published binaries don't pick up weak `pidfd_spawnp`/`pidfd_getpid` symbols from GLIBC_2.39 that resolve to NULL and segfault when tokio spawns a subprocess on Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, RHEL 9, and similar distros.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Cross-platform Flutter client** with WebSocket JSON-RPC backend: desktop app (macOS, Linux), web WASM build, bidirectional permission prompting, heartbeat-based dead client detection, auto-update checker. Shared Dart client library at `packages/agent_code_client/`
- **Behavioral evaluation framework**: `crates/eval/` with `eval_test!` macro, `TestRig` with workspace setup and tool log capture, best-of-4 retry logic for LLM non-determinism, two policy tiers (`AlwaysPasses` / `UsuallyPasses`), breakpoint mechanism for model steering tests. Ships with 10 seed evals
- **Shell passthrough context injection**: `!` prefix now streams output in real-time (piped subprocess instead of `.output()`) and injects captured output into conversation history as `is_meta` message. Agent can reference shell output in subsequent turns without copy-pasting. 50KB truncation prevents context bloat
- **Prompt caching for tool definitions**: `cache_control: { type: "ephemeral" }` on the last tool in the tools array, caching the full prefix (system prompt + 32 tools). New `features.prompt_caching` config toggle (default: true)
- **Scheduled agents**: `agent cron add` for recurring agent execution, `agent trigger --listen` for webhook-triggered runs, background daemon for unattended operation
- **`/powerup` interactive tutorials**: 5 step-by-step lessons teaching core features. Arrow-key lesson picker with persistent progress tracking. Aliases: `/tutorial`, `/learn`
- **Homebrew tap auto-update**: release workflow automatically updates `avala-ai/homebrew-tap` formula with new version and SHA256 checksums on every tagged release
- **Shell passthrough test suite**: 40 tests across 3 layers (25 unit, 11 integration, 4 E2E bash). Extracted capture logic into `services/shell_passthrough.rs` for testability
- **Detailed v1.1/v1.2 roadmap**: 15 feature specifications with architecture diagrams, config schemas, and implementation checklists

### Changed

- **Shell passthrough refactored**: `!` handler in `repl.rs` reduced from 92 lines to 19 lines by extracting into `services/shell_passthrough.rs` library module
- **Prompt caching wired to config**: `enable_caching` in query loop now reads `features.prompt_caching` instead of hardcoded `true`

### Fixed

- **E2E D10 coding task**: made resilient to context overflow during long agent sessions

## [0.13.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- **E2E C2 test**: `jq -e` treats JSON `false` and `0` as falsy — switched to `has()` for boolean/numeric status fields

### Added

- **Coding task E2E tests** (D9, D10): agent writes Python fizzbuzz and bash arithmetic scripts, tests verify the generated code actually runs and produces correct output

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Azure OpenAI provider**: first-class support with `api-key` header auth, Azure AD token fallback (`AZURE_OPENAI_AD_TOKEN`), configurable API version — 16 providers total

- **Remote skill discovery**: `/skill search`, `/skill install <name>`, `/skill remove <name>`, `/skill installed` with configurable index URL and offline cache fallback
- **`--attach [session-id]`**: connect to a specific serve instance by session ID prefix, with interactive selection when multiple instances are running
- **Provider health check in `/doctor`**: detects active provider, uses provider-specific auth headers for connectivity test, warns on missing env vars
- **Rustdoc via CI**: `cargo doc` builds alongside mdBook and deploys to GitHub Pages at `/api/`
- **Rustdoc comments**: `///` docs on all remaining public types in the llm module
- **E2E test expansion**: 31 → 60+ tests covering ACP protocol, SSE endpoint, CLI flags, protected directories, custom skills, config variants, and edge cases

### Fixed

- **E2E C3 flake**: POST /message uses 240s timeout with automatic retry for LLM cold-start latency

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Cohere provider**: Command R+, Command R, Command Light (`COHERE_API_KEY`)
- **Perplexity provider**: Sonar Pro, Sonar, Sonar Deep Research with web search (`PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`) — 15 providers total
- **`agent --attach`**: connect to a running `--serve` instance from another terminal with auto-discovery via bridge lock files
